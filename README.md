# C Programming Class Assignments ![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/c-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white)🌵


This repository contains my solutions for the C programming class assignments.

## Structure

Each assignment is placed in its own directory. The directory name corresponds to the assignment number.

## Building and Running

To build and run an assignment, navigate to its directory and use the gcc compiler:

```bash
gcc -o output_file_name source_file_name.c
./output_file_name
