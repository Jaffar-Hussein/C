# C Programming Class Assignments ðŸŒµ

This repository contains my solutions for the C programming class assignments.

## Structure

Each assignment is placed in its own directory. The directory name corresponds to the assignment number.

```bash
gcc -o output_file_name source_file_name.c
./output_file_name
