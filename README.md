This repository contains my solutions for the C programming class assignments.

## Structure

Each assignment is placed in its own directory. The directory name corresponds to the assignment number.

## Assignments

1. [Assignment 1 - Introduction to C](./TP_1/)
   - Exercises:
     - Exercise 1 - Hello World (`./TP_1/1.c`)
     - Exercise 2 - Basic Arithmetic (`/assignment1/exercise2`)
     - Exercise 3 - Control Structures (`/assignment1/exercise3`)
2. Assignment 2 - Arrays and Strings
   - Exercises:
     - Exercise 1 - Array Manipulation (`/assignment2/exercise1`)
     - Exercise 2 - String Manipulation (`/assignment2/exercise2`)
     - Exercise 3 - Multidimensional Arrays (`/assignment2/exercise3`)

## Building and Running

To build and run an assignment, navigate to its directory and use the gcc compiler:

```bash
gcc -o output_file_name source_file_name.c
./output_file_name
