This repository contains my solutions for the C programming class assignments.

## Structure

Each assignment is placed in its own directory. The directory name corresponds to the assignment number.

## Assignments

1. [Assignment 1](./TP_1/) - Introduction to C
2. [Assignment 2](./TP_2/) - Arrays and Strings
3. [Assignment 3](./TP_3) - 2D, 3D Arrays and Pointers
4. [Assignment 4](./TP_4) - Loops and Conditions
5. [Assignment 5](./TP_5) - Structs and Enums
6. [Assignment 6](./TP_6) - Read and Writing Files

## Building and Running

To build and run an assignment, navigate to its directory and use the gcc compiler:

```bash
gcc -o output_file_name source_file_name.c
./output_file_name
